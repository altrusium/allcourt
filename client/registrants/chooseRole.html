      <p>Lebowski ipsum sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house. I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski? Zere ARE no ROOLZ! Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski! My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites. This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is—are you ready for this? —Arthur Digby Sellers.</p>

      <p>Goodnight, sweet prince. Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour. But that is up to little Larry here. Isn't it, Larry? Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski. The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software. Wave of the future, Dude. 100% electronic. And so, Theodore Donald Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well.</p>

      <p>Eight-year-olds, Dude. Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. If I can find your money, man— what's in it for the Dude? They call Los Angeles the City of Angels. I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there. 'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says. But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story I'm about to unfold —wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me.</p>

      <p>No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the impression that we're police exactly. We're hoping that it will not be necessary to call the police. No, look. I do mind. The Dude minds. This will not stand, you know, this aggression will not stand, man. Thankie… Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words? Walter, this isn't a First Amendment thing. Yeah man. Well, you know, the Dude abides.</p>

      <p>Ja, it seems you forgot our little deal, Lebowski. You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday. Hardly Dude, a new 'vette? The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options. Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski. That guy treats objects like women, man. I'll get you a toe by this afternoon —with nail polish.</p>
